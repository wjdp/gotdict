    Night's King
    
  </h1>
  <p>The Night’s King is a legendary Lord Commander of the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a>, who lived during the Age of Heroes.According to legend, the Night’s King lived during the Age of Heroes, not long after the <a href="#wall">Wall</a> was complete. He was a fearless warrior, who was named the thirteenth Lord Commander of the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a>. Later he fell in love with a woman “with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars”, he chased her and loved her though “her skin was cold as ice”, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well. (Her description matches that of the <a href="#the-others">Others</a>.)</p>

<p>He brought her back to the <a href="#nightfort">Nightfort</a> and after the unholy union, he declared himself king and her his queen, and ruled the <a href="#nightfort">Nightfort</a> as his own castle for thirteen years. During the dark years of his reign, horrific atrocities were committed, of which tales are still told in the <a href="#north">North</a>. It was not until his own brother, the King in the <a href="#north">North</a>, and <a href="#joramun">Joramun</a>, the King-Beyond-the-<a href="#wall">Wall</a>, joined forces that the Night’s King was brought down and the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a> freed. After his fall, when it was discovered that he had been sacrificing to the <a href="#the-others">Others</a> (possibly in similar way to <a href="#craster">Craster</a>), all records of him were destroyed and his very name was forbidden. It is likely this led the lords of the <a href="#north">North</a> to forbid the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a> to construct walls at their keeps, ensuring the keeps would always be accessible from the south.</p>
