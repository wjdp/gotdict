  <p>Azor Ahai was a legendary hero who lived approximately eight thousand years before <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a>’s Landing. It is said that during the midst of The Long Night, Azor Ahai rose up and defeated the <a href="#the-others">Others</a>, wielding a sword of fire, called Lightbringer. Some readers believe that Azor Ahai is the same hero as the prince that was promised, while others believe that they come from two distinct prophecies.</p>

<p>The Legend of Lightbringer: Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero’s sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, <a href="#nissa-nissa">Nissa Nissa</a>, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer.</p>
