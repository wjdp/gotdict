  <p>Gerion Lannister was a member of <a href="#house-lannister">House Lannister</a>. He was the youngest and most reckless brother of <a href="#tywin-lannister">Tywin Lannister</a>, the head of the house.<a href="#tyrion-lannister">Tyrion</a> and <a href="#jaime-lannister">Jaime</a> often refer to him as their favourite uncle. He prized and supported <a href="#tyrion-lannister">Tyrion</a> when the dwarf recited historical facts memorized by heart or cartwheeled across the supper table in <a href="#casterly-rock">Casterly Rock</a>’s great hall. He once gifted <a href="#tyrion-lannister">Tyrion</a> with the books Wonders and Wonders Made by Man by <a href="#lomas-estermont">Lomas</a> Longstrider and often had <a href="#tyrion-lannister">Tyrion</a> recite the sixteen wonders of the <a href="#known-world">World</a>.</p>

<p>Like his brothers, <a href="#kevan-lannister">Kevan</a> and <a href="#tygett-lannister">Tygett</a>, Gerion was overshadowed by their older brother <a href="#tywin-lannister">Tywin Lannister</a>. While <a href="#kevan-lannister">Kevan</a> build up a life near <a href="#tywin-lannister">Tywin</a> and <a href="#tygett-lannister">Tygett</a> tried to be independent, Gerion mocked this “game” and made jokes. He was said to be a man quick to laugh and had a gift for making others laugh. Gerion had a natural daughter; <a href="#joy-hill">Joy Hill</a>.</p>

<p>Later Gerion went on a quest to find the ancestral sword Brightroar and any other treasures that might have survived the Doom of <a href="#valyria">Valyria</a> circa 292 AL. Almost a decade passed after his ship the <a href="#laughing-lion">Laughing Lion</a> left <a href="#lannisport">Lannisport</a> but Gerion never returned. <a href="#tywin-lannister">Tywin Lannister</a> sent men to look for his lost brother and they traced him as far as <a href="#volantis">Volantis</a>, where half his crew had deserted him because of his intent to sail into the <a href="#smoking-sea">Smoking Sea</a>. He had to buy slaves to replace them.</p>

<p>What happened to him and if he is still alive is unknown, although he is most likely dead as few survive a journey to the ruins of <a href="#valyria">Valyria</a>.</p>
