    House Tyrell

  </h1>
  <p>House Tyrell of <a href="#highgarden">Highgarden</a> is one of the Great Houses of the <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>, overlords over the <a href="#the-reach">Reach</a>. A large, wealthy house, its wealth is only surpassed among the Great Houses by <a href="#house-lannister">House Lannister</a>, and the Tyrells can field the greatest armies. Additionally, if they call the fleets of their bannermen the Redwynes, the lords of the <a href="#shield-islands">Shield Islands</a>, and the coastal lords, they can command a navy that equals if not surpasses the royal fleet.</p>

<p><a href="#highgarden">Highgarden</a> is an ancient seat of rule and the heart of chivalry in the <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>; the Tyrells style themselves ‘Defenders of the Marches’ and ‘High Marshals of the <a href="#the-reach">Reach</a>’, and traditionally, they have been Wardens of the South. Their sigil is a golden rose on a green field, and their words are “Growing <a href="#house-strong">Strong</a>.” Members of the family tend to have curly brown hair and brown or golden eyes.</p>

<p>The Tyrells trace their line of descent, through the female line, to the legendary <a href="#garth-greenhand">Garth Greenhand</a>, the first King of the <a href="#the-reach">Reach</a>, in the Age of Heroes(indicating their origin among the Andal invaders thousands of years before). The Tyrells were stewards to <a href="#house-gardener">House Gardener</a>, the ancient ruling line of Kings of the <a href="#the-reach">Reach</a>, who periodically intermarried with lower ranking houses of the <a href="#the-reach">Reach</a> such as House Tyrell or <a href="#house-florent">House Florent</a>. Following the defeat and death of King Mern IX, at the Field of Fire, Lord <a href="#harlen-tyrell">Harlen Tyrell</a>, hereditary high steward of the <a href="#the-reach">Reach</a>, surrendered <a href="#highgarden">Highgarden</a> and was granted the castle along with dominion of the <a href="#the-reach">Reach</a> by <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> the Conqueror. As Wardens of the South they frequently warred with the <a href="#dornishmen">Dornishmen</a>, who remained independent.</p>
