  <p>Mance Rayder was once a man of the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a> before breaking his vows and abandoning his post. He has since become extremely influential among the wildlings, and called “The King Beyond the <a href="#wall">Wall</a>”.</p>

<p>Mance is a big man, long legged and lean, broad in the chest and shoulders. His once long brown hair is now gone mostly grey, laughter lines appear at the corner of his mouth. He has a sharp face and shrewd brown eyes. He is an unremarkable-looking man in his middle years, with a fondness for music.</p>

<p>Mance was a wildling child taken by the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a> and raised as one of them. He was a loyal member of the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a> for most of his life until he suffered an injury while ranging, and was healed by a wildling woman. While he recuperated, she mended his torn cloak with swatches of red fabric. Upon returning to the <a href="#wall">Wall</a>, the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a> commanders required him to replace his mended cloak with one of uniform black. This infringement of freedom caused him to abandon the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a> and live with the wildlings in the way he wished.</p>
