  <p>Daenerys Targaryen, known as Daenerys Stormborn or Dany, is the last confirmed member of the ancient Targaryen Dynasty. Daenerys is a young woman in her early teens. She is short of stature and very beautiful, with the silver-blonde hair and purple eyes for which <a href="#house-targaryen">House Targaryen</a> has always been known.</p>

<p>In her youth, Dany was a meek, timid girl with little confidence or self-esteem. She knew no life other than one of exile, dependent and in constant fear of her brother <a href="#viserys-targaryen">Viserys</a>. He was the only family she knew, but was often a cruel guardian, prone to mood swings and fits of violence.</p>

<p>Daenerys is the only daughter and youngest child of King <a href="#aerys-ii-targaryen">Aerys II Targaryen</a> and his sister-wife, Queen <a href="#rhaella-targaryen">Rhaella</a>. Daenerys was conceived during the last month of the rebellion that would ultimately end her family’s reign over the <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>. Shortly thereafter, her mother was sent with the young prince <a href="#viserys-targaryen">Viserys</a> to the family ancestral seat of <a href="#dragonstone">Dragonstone</a> to escape the coming Sack of <a href="#kings-landing">King’s Landing</a>. Daenerys was born while a great storm raged above <a href="#dragonstone">Dragonstone</a>, sinking what remained of the Targaryen fleet, for this reason she is sometimes known as “Daenerys Stormborn.” Her mother died in labor.</p>

<p>By this time, the war was already lost. <a href="#robert-baratheon">Robert Baratheon</a> had claimed the throne and Aerys had already been killed along with the rest of the royal family, leaving Daenerys and her older brother <a href="#viserys-targaryen">Viserys</a> as the only known living Targaryen heirs. The garrison at <a href="#dragonstone">Dragonstone</a> decided to surrender and turn them over to the rebels in exchange for their lives, but before they could act on this plan, Ser <a href="#willem-darry">Willem Darry</a> and several other loyal retainers rescued the children and smuggled them into exile, sailing to the Free City of <a href="#braavos">Braavos</a>, where they lived for years in a house with a red door.</p>
