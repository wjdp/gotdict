    Nightfort
    
  </h1>
  <p>The Nightfort is one of the castles along the <a href="#wall">Wall</a>. It is the only castle along the <a href="#wall">Wall</a> where the steps up the side of the <a href="#wall">Wall</a> were carved into the ice. It was abandoned by the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a> two hundred years before the War of the Five Kings. The last brothers to inhabit the castle were reassigned to <a href="#deep-lake">Deep Lake</a>. It sits between <a href="#icemark">Icemark</a> to the west and <a href="#deep-lake">Deep Lake</a> to the east. It was the first castle on the <a href="#wall">Wall</a>, and the largest. With the dwindling of <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a> power it became three-quarters empty and too costly to maintain. When Good Queen <a href="#alysanne-targaryen">Alysanne Targaryen</a> suggested to pay for a new smaller castle, the Watch agreed to abandon it. The new castle, <a href="#deep-lake">Deep Lake</a>, was paid for by the queen’s jewels and built by men that King Jaehaerys I sent north. Once the new castle was completed, the Nightfort was abandoned.</p>

<p>Three hundred years before <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a>’s Landing, the commanders of the Nightfort and Snowgate went to war with each other. Eventually, both lost their heads to the Starks of <a href="#winterfell">Winterfell</a>.</p>

<p>It is remembered in scary stories of the <a href="#north">North</a>, although doubtlessly many of them are false. It was there that <a href="#nights-king">Night’s King</a> reigned before his name was wiped from the memory of man, and where the <a href="#rat-cook">Rat Cook</a> served the Andal king his prince-and-bacon pie, where the 79 sentinels stood their watch, where brave young <a href="#danny-flint">Danny Flint</a> had been raped and murdered, where King <a href="#sherrit">Sherrit</a> had called down his curse of the <a href="#andals">Andals</a> of old, where the apprentice boys had faced the thing that came in the night, where blind <a href="#symeon-stareyes">Symeon Star-Eyes</a> had seen the Hellhounds fight, and where Mad Axe had walked the yards and climbed the towers to butcher his brothers in the dark.</p>
