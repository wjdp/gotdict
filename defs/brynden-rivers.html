    Brynden Rivers
    
  </h1>
  <p>Lord Brynden Rivers, called “Bloodraven”, was a legitimized Great Bastard of <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> IV and Mylessa <a href="#house-blackwood">Blackwood</a>, his sixth mistress. His personal arms were a white dragon with red eyes breathing red flame on a black field. During his life, he was a <a href="#house-targaryen">Targaryen</a> loyalist during the <a href="#the-first-blackfyre-rebellion">Blackfyre Rebellion</a>, the Hand of Aerys I, and Lord Commander of the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a>. <a href="#shiera-crakehall">Shiera</a> Seastar, another bastard of <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> IV, was his mistress. His half-brother Bittersteel desired <a href="#shiera-crakehall">Shiera</a> also, which served in increasing the enmity between the two. He was thought to be a sorcerer. An albino, Brynden had milk white skin, long white hair, and red eyes. He had a red birthmark that extended from his throat up to his right cheek. Some thought that it resembled a bird. Brynden was not as tall or muscular as his half-brothers. He typically wore the colors of “blood and smoke”, with smoke being a dark grey that was mottled and streaked with black. Because his skin was sensitive to light, he usually went about cloaked and hooded. He lost an eye during the <a href="#the-first-blackfyre-rebellion">Blackfyre Rebellion</a> and rarely covered the empty socket with a patch. He wore his white hair straight and to his shoulders, with the front brushed forward to cover his missing eye.</p>
