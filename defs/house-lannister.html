  <p>House Lannister of <a href="#casterly-rock">Casterly Rock</a> is one of the Great Houses of <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>, and the principal house of the <a href="#westerlands">Westerlands</a>. Their seat is <a href="#casterly-rock">Casterly Rock</a>, though another branch exists that is based in nearby <a href="#lannisport">Lannisport</a>. Their sigil is a golden lion on a field of crimson. Their official motto is “Hear me roar!” However their unofficial motto, equally well known, is “A Lannister always pays his debts.</p>

<p>The Lannisters reigned as Kings of the Rock until they fell to the <a href="#house-targaryen">Targaryen</a> conquest, but were allowed to remain the paramount lords of the <a href="#westerlands">Westerlands</a>. The House had fallen on hard times during the rule of <a href="#tytos">Tytos</a>, but was restored to its former glory by <a href="#tywin-lannister">Tywin</a>. The Lannisters are the richest family in the <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>, due in large part to the many gold mines under their control, despite by no means being the largest kingdom and being rather mountainous.</p>

<p>The Lannisters descend from Andal adventurers who married the daughters of the King of the Rock. The King himself descended from <a href="#lann-the-clever">Lann the Clever</a>, a legendary trickster from the Age of Heroes who tricked the Casterlys into giving him <a href="#casterly-rock">Casterly Rock</a>. The Lannisters reigned as Kings of the Rock until the <a href="#house-targaryen">Targaryen</a> conquest. Afer the Field of Fire, King <a href="#loren-lannister">Loren</a> I surrendered and his House was allowed to remain the paramount lords of the westerlands. The Lannisters are the richest family in the <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>, due in large part to the many gold mines under their control. House Lannister once possessed an ancestral <a href="#valyrian">Valyrian</a> steel greatsword called Brightroar; but it has long been lost.</p>
