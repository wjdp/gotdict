    Thenn
    
  </h1>
  <p>Thenn is a region located in the northernmost area beyond the <a href="#wall">Wall</a>. It is located in a mountain valley in the peaks of the <a href="#frostfangs">Frostfangs</a>. Thenn lies at almost the northern end of the <a href="#frostfangs">Frostfangs</a>. The inhabitants are called the Thenn. The Thenn consider themselves the last of the <a href="#first-men">First Men</a>, they speak the Old Tongue and most have only a few words of the Common Tongue. The Thenn led by the <a href="#magnar">Magnar</a>, who is considered more a god than a man by his people. According to <a href="#jon">Jon</a>, the Thenn are more sophisticated and closer to people south to the wall, because they have laws and lords in their valley.</p>

<p>The Thenns are savage fighters, but because of their belief in their <a href="#magnar">Magnar</a> as their god they are absolutely obedient and much more disciplined than other wildlings. They are often better equipped than most wildlings, with bronze helms, axes of bronze and a few axes of chipped stone, short stabbing spears with leaf-shaped heads, shirts sewn with bronze discs, and plain unadorned shields of black boiled leather with bronze rims and bosses.</p>
