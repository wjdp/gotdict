  <p>Baelor I, known as the Beloved and the Blessed, was the ninth Targaryen king to reign on the Iron Throne. Known for his piety, Baelor was a <a href="#septon">septon</a> as well as a king. He was the second son of <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> III and ruled after the death of his brother <a href="#daeron-vaith">Daeron</a> I Targaryen. The Great <a href="#sept">Sept</a> of Baelor in <a href="#kings-landing">King’s Landing</a> features a statue of him. None of the Targaryen dynasty’s kings are as beloved as Baelor, he loved the smallfolk and the gods in equal parts - yet imprisoned his own sisters. Baelor was a peaceful, devoted and pious man. He was very thin and frail looking from his repeated fasts. He wore a long beard and hair of typical Targaryen silver-gold color. His crown was made of flowers and vines. Some remember Baelor as a great and holy man, given to deep prayer and fasting to experience religious visions, and honor him for his contributions to the <a href="#faith-of-the-seven">Faith</a>, including the construction of the Great <a href="#sept">Sept</a> in <a href="#kings-landing">King’s Landing</a>. <a href="#the-others">Others</a> regard him as a weak, simpering fool, prone to hallucinations and bad decisions brought about by excessive zealotry.</p>
