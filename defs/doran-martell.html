  <p>Doran Nymeros Martell is the Prince of <a href="#dorne">Dorne</a> and Lord of <a href="#sunspear">Sunspear</a>. He is a cautious, pensive man who does not wear his emotions on his sleeve. He has a bad case of gout and has trouble walking. He attempts to appear neutral in the War of the Five Kings, but has shown a desire to avenge his murdered sister <a href="#elia-martell">Elia Martell</a>.</p>

<p>He is rarely seen in public because of the gout, as he does not want to appear weak to his enemies. He met his wife <a href="#mellario-of-norvos">Mellario of Norvos</a> while traveling in the <a href="#free-cities">Free Cities</a>. They fell in love and married. Although <a href="#mellario-of-norvos">Mellario</a> was high born enough to become his wife, most marriages between nobles in <a href="#westeros">Westeros</a> are political marriages and a love match is very uncommon. The couple had three children. Although they married out of love, the marriage was not very happy. <a href="#mellario-of-norvos">Mellario</a> could not get used to Dornish customs.</p>

<p>Shortly after the birth of <a href="#trystane-martell">Trystane</a>, <a href="#quentyn">Quentyn</a> was sent to be fostered as the ward and squire of Lord <a href="#anders-yronwood">Anders Yronwood</a>. This was done to make peace with the Yronwoods after the previous Lord <a href="#ormond-yronwood">Ormond Yronwood</a> had died of his wounds taken in a duel with <a href="#oberyn-martell">Oberyn</a>. <a href="#mellario-of-norvos">Mellario</a> did not approve and went back to <a href="#norvos">Norvos</a>. He avoids the commoners and only sees his trusted courtiers and advisors to hide his weakness from his enemies.</p>
