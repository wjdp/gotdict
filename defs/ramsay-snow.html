  </h1>
  <p>Ramsay <a href="#house-bolton">Bolton</a> is the legitimated bastard son of Lord <a href="#roose-bolton">Roose Bolton</a>. Originally named Ramsay Snow, he was known as the Bastard of <a href="#house-bolton">Bolton</a> and the Bastard of the <a href="#dreadfort">Dreadfort</a>. Ramsay considers himself a true <a href="#house-bolton">Bolton</a> despite his birth and is highly resentful of his <a href="#bastards">baseborn</a> status, referring to himself proudly as the trueborn scion of the <a href="#dreadfort">Dreadfort</a> and violently correcting those who refer to him otherwise.</p>

<p>Ramsay has a group of men at arms who stand high in his favor and follow him loyally, although their true allegiance lies with Lord <a href="#roose-bolton">Roose</a>. They are called the “Bastard Boys,” though never within their or Ramsay’s hearing, and are just as depraved as Ramsay. Ramsay’s personal steed is named Blood.</p>

<p>He is an ugly man. Even splendorous garb cannot disguise this fact. He is big boned and slope shouldered, with a fleshiness to him that suggests that later in life he will turn to fat. His skin is pink and blotchy, his nose broad, his mouth small, his hair long and dark and dry. His lips are wide and meaty, wormy looking, but the thing that men notice most about him are his eyes. He has his lord father’s eyes, small, close-set and queerly pale. Ghost grey some men call the shade, but in truth his eyes are all but colourless, like two chips of dirty ice. He smiles a wet lipped smile. He sometimes wears a garnet cut in the shape of a drop of blood in his right ear.</p>

<p>Ramsay is a sadist; he is cruel, savage and wild, taking delight in torturing others. He is quite fond of the old <a href="#house-bolton">Bolton</a> custom of flaying their enemies alive.</p>
