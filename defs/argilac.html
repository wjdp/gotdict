  <h1>
    
    Argilac
    
  </h1>
  <p>Argilac Durrendon, also known as Argilac the Arrogant, was the last Storm King who reigned in the <a href="#stormlands">Stormlands</a> before the Conquest by <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> I. Argilac was probably the Storm King who sided with <a href="#tyrosh">Tyrosh</a>, <a href="#lys">Lys</a>, <a href="#myr">Myr</a>, and <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> when that alliance broke Volantene hegemony at the end of the “Bleeding Years.” <a href="#harren">Harren</a> the Black, the King of the <a href="#iron-islands">Iron Islands</a> and the <a href="#riverlands">Riverlands</a>, was nearing completion of his massive castle, <a href="#harrenhal">Harrenhal</a>, and was said to be looking for more conquests. Argilac had grown afraid of <a href="#harren">Harren</a> and so proposed an alliance with <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a>. It is believed he wanted to create a buffer zone between his kingdom and <a href="#harren">Harren</a>’s. He offered the hand of his daughter, Argella, in marriage as well as dowry lands, though, much of the lands were in fact in the possession of <a href="#harren">Harren</a> the Black. <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> refused and instead offered the hand of his best friend and rumored bastard brother, Orys <a href="#house-baratheon">Baratheon</a>. Argilac took this as a grave insult and had the hands of the envoy cut off. He sent them to <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> with a message of “These are the only hands you will receive”. <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> called his banners and took counsel with them and his sisters. Then <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> sent ravens to the rulers of the <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>. He informed them that “There will be only one King” and that those who bent the knee would keep their lands and titles. But those that did not he would destroy. King Argilac refused to submit. After landing and proclaiming himself Lord of the <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a> and King of <a href="#westeros">Westeros</a>, <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> named Orys <a href="#house-baratheon">Baratheon</a> the <a href="#hand-of-the-king">Hand of the King</a> and sent him with Rhaenys to take <a href="#storms-end">Storm’s End</a>. Though Orys met with some setbacks, he continued to march on <a href="#storms-end">Storm’s End</a>. King Argilac refused to be trapped inside his castle like King <a href="#harren">Harren</a>, so he came out to meet the invaders. He attacked Orys’s forces while a huge storm raged, in what became known as the Battle of the Last Storm. Argilac outnumbered Orys’ army two-to-one and outflanked it, but Rhaenys and her dragon, <a href="#balerion">Meraxes</a>, stopped them. Orys came face-to-face with Argilac and slew him in single combat. In order to reward his rumored bastard half-brother Orys, <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> gave him Argilac’s lands and the hand of the dead king’s daughter. Orys kept the banner, honors and words of House Durrendon.</p>
