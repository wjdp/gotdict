    Baelor Targaryen
    
  </h1>
  <p>Baelor Targaryen, known as Baelor Breakspear, was the eldest son of King <a href="#daeron-vaith">Daeron</a> II Targaryen and <a href="#myriah-martell">Myriah Martell</a>. He was named after King <a href="#baelor-i-targaryen">Baelor I</a>. From 194 to 209 AL, Prince Baelor served as his father’s Hand. Prince Baelor had the dark hair of his mother, a Dornish princess. He kept it cut short and kept his jaw clean-shaven. His nose had been broken twice.</p>

<p>When the <a href="#the-first-blackfyre-rebellion">Blackfyre Rebellion</a> was in its early stages, Prince Baelor advocated leniency toward <a href="#daemon-blackfyre">Daemon Blackfyre</a>, a position that was not favored over his uncle Bloodraven’s hard line. Nonetheless, Baelor accepted the path towards war. He distinguished himself by leading the Dornish-<a href="#stormlands">Stormlands</a> force which attacked the rearguard of the rebel army during the Battle of the Redgrass Field, smashing them against the shield-wall of his brother Prince Maekar and inspiring the song The <a href="#hammer">Hammer</a> and Anvil. After the battle, he was named <a href="#hand-of-the-king">Hand of the King</a> by his father and was recognized as a good Hand and “the soul of chivalry.” At some point he was also given the title of Protector of the Realm.</p>
