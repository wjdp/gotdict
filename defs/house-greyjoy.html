    House Greyjoy
    
    <span class="terms">(

  </h1>
  <p>House Greyjoy of <a href="#pyke">Pyke</a> is one of the Great Houses of <a href="#westeros">Westeros</a> ruling over the <a href="#iron-islands">Iron Islands</a> - a harsh and bleak collection of forbidding islands off the west coast of <a href="#westeros">Westeros</a> - from the castle and island of <a href="#pyke">Pyke</a>. Their sigil is a golden kraken on a black field, and their house motto is “We Do Not Sow.” Members of the family tend to be attractive and well-built, with black hair.</p>

<p>The House descends from the <a href="#grey-king">Grey King</a>, a legendary figure from the Age of Heroes. The Greyjoys became the lords paramount of the Iron Isles during the <a href="#house-targaryen">Targaryen</a> Conquest: after <a href="#aegon">Aegon</a> I extinguished <a href="#house-hoare">House Hoare</a>, he allowed the ironborn to choose who would have primacy over them. They chose <a href="#vickon-greyjoy">Vickon Greyjoy</a> and his line. The Greyjoys have ruled ever since, from their formidable castle of <a href="#pyke">Pyke</a>. The ironborn, however, did lose the <a href="#riverlands">Riverlands</a>, which were granted to <a href="#edmyn-tully">Edmyn Tully</a> and his descendents.</p>

<p>Thus relegated to their dismal homeland and constrained by the king’s peace, the Greyjoys have kept themselves distant from the other Great Houses, rarely taking part in events on the mainland (which they call the “green lands”). At various times they have tried to return to their ancient practices of raiding the western coastlines, such as under <a href="#lord-dagon">Lord Dagon</a>. Six years after holding aloof during <a href="#roberts-rebellion">Robert’s Rebellion</a>, Lord <a href="#balon-greyjoy">Balon Greyjoy</a> led his own rebellion against the Iron Throne, declaring himself King of the <a href="#iron-islands">Iron Islands</a>. He was defeated, his fleet burned and his two eldest sons <a href="#rodrik">Rodrik</a> and <a href="#maron">Maron</a> were slain during the war. His last son <a href="#theon-greyjoy">Theon</a> was given as a hostage and ward to Lord <a href="#eddard-stark">Eddard Stark</a> and he again swore <a href="#fealty">fealty</a> to <a href="#house-baratheon">House Baratheon</a> of <a href="#kings-landing">King’s Landing</a>.</p>
