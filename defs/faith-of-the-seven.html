  <p>The Faith of the Seven is the dominant religion of the <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>, and is often simply referred to as “the Faith”. The only parts of <a href="#westeros">Westeros</a> where the Faith is not widespread are the <a href="#north">North</a> and the <a href="#iron-islands">Iron Islands</a>, where the practice of the Old Gods and of the Drowned God respectively are still strong.</p>

<p>The Faith worships the Seven, a single deity with seven aspects or faces, each representing a different virtue. Worshipers pray to specific aspects of the Seven for help and guidance depending on their need. This aspects are:</p>

<p>Father, or the Father Above, representing judgment. He is depicted as a bearded man who carries scales, and is prayed to for justice.</p>

<p>Mother, or the Mother Above, representing motherhood and nurturing. She is prayed to for fertility or compassion, and is depicted as smiling with love, embodying the concept of mercy.</p>

<p>Warrior, representing strength in battle. He is prayed to for courage and victory. He carries a sword.</p>

<p>Maiden, representing innocence and chastity. She is usually prayed to to protect a maiden’s virtue.</p>

<p>Smith, representing crafts and labor. He is usually prayed to when work needs to be done, for strength. He carries a hammer.</p>

<p>Crone, representing wisdom. She carries a lantern and is prayed to for guidance.</p>

<p>Stranger. An exception to the other aspects, the Stranger represents death and the unknown. Worshipers rarely seek favor from the Stranger, but outcasts sometimes associate themselves with this god.</p>
