  </h1>
  <p>Ser Arthur Dayne, known as the Sword of the Morning, was a famed and legendary knight and a member of Aerys II’s <a href="#kingsguard">Kingsguard</a>. He was Prince <a href="#rhaegar">Rhaegar</a>’s closest friend. His accomplishments include defeating the <a href="#kingswood-brotherhood">Kingswood Brotherhood</a>. He got the smallfolk to love him by paying for what he and his forces took and taking their grievances before King Aerys II. In the end he slayed the <a href="#smiling-knight">Smiling Knight</a> in single combat and ended the threat of the Brotherhood. Following that victory, he knighted <a href="#jaime-lannister">Jaime Lannister</a>, who would later become a sworn brother of the <a href="#kingsguard">Kingsguard</a>.</p>

<p>He broke twelve lances against Prince <a href="#rhaegar-targaryen">Rhaegar Targaryen</a> in a tourney held at <a href="#storms-end">Storm’s End</a>, losing to the prince. At the Tourney at <a href="#harrenhal">Harrenhal</a>, he was defeated by Prince <a href="#rhaegar">Rhaegar</a> once again.</p>

<p>He wielded the greatsword called Dawn as part of his office as Sword of the Morning, carrying it slung across his back. He died at the <a href="#tower-of-joy">Tower of Joy</a> fighting <a href="#eddard-stark">Eddard Stark</a> and his companions, but the exact circumstances of his death are unclear.</p>

<p>In a memory of his father, <a href="#brandon-stark-bran">Bran</a> <a href="#house-stark">Stark</a> recalls his father describing Arthur Dayne as the finest knight he ever saw, and elaborates further that Dayne would have killed him if not for <a href="#howland-reed">Howland Reed</a>. Dayne is remembered as not only a skilled fighter but a valiant and true knight. <a href="#eddard-stark">Eddard Stark</a>, <a href="#jaime-lannister">Jaime Lannister</a> and <a href="#barristan-selmy">Barristan Selmy</a> all recall or remember Dayne with nothing less than absolute respect for both the man and his legend.</p>
