    House Stark

  </h1>
  <p>House Stark of <a href="#winterfell">Winterfell</a> is one of the Great Houses of <a href="#westeros">Westeros</a> and the principal noble house of The <a href="#north">North</a>; many lesser houses are sworn to them. In days of old they ruled as Kings of Winter; since the <a href="#house-targaryen">Targaryen</a> Conquest they have been Wardens of the <a href="#north">North</a>. Their seat, <a href="#winterfell">Winterfell</a>, is an ancient castle renowned for its strength. Their sigil is a grey direwolf racing across a field of white, and their words are “Winter Is Coming,” one of only a few house mottoes to be a warning rather than a boast. Members of the family tend to be lean of build and long of face, with dark brown hair and grey eyes.</p>

<p>The Starks are an ancient house, descended from <a href="#bran-the-builder">Bran the Builder</a>, a legendary figure from the Age of Heroes, who raised their ancestral home at <a href="#winterfell">Winterfell</a> thousands of years in the past, as well as the <a href="#wall">Wall</a>. They are descendants of the <a href="#first-men">First Men</a> and still follow some of their ancient traditions and the Old Gods of the forest. The Starks were Kings of Winter in the <a href="#north">North</a> for many thousands of years from the Age of Heroes, possibly beginning with <a href="#bran-the-builder">Bran the Builder</a>. Ever since <a href="#brandon-stark-bran">Bran</a> constructed the <a href="#wall">Wall</a>, the Starks have been friends of the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a>, and have manned the <a href="#wall">Wall</a> for thousands of years. The <a href="#nights-king">Night’s King</a>, the attainted 13th Lord Commander of the <a href="#nights-watch">Night’s Watch</a>, is said to have been a Stark, among his many possible origins. The Starks also helped repel several major wildling invasions, such as when they and their <a href="#house-umber">Umber</a> bannermen defeated the Kings-Beyond-the-<a href="#wall">Wall</a> like the brothers <a href="#gendel">Gendel</a> and <a href="#gorne">Gorne</a>, as well as <a href="#bael">Bael</a> the Bard, who both sired and fought a Stark.</p>

<p>The known members of this house are:</p>

<p><a href="#brandon-stark">Brandon Stark</a>, eldest son and heir of Lord <a href="#rickard">Rickard</a> Stark. Slain along with his father by order of <a href="#aerys-ii-targaryen">the Mad King</a>.</p>
