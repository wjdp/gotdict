  </h1>
  <p>Ser Gregor Clegane is head of <a href="#house-clegane">House Clegane</a> which are landed knights and bannermen to <a href="#house-lannister">House Lannister</a>. Gregor is a freakishly large man and for this he is often called The Mountain That Rides or simply The Mountain. Gregor Clegane is well known for his size, cruelty, and prowess in battle. Gregor is extremely tall (close to eight feet). He has “massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunk of small trees.” Gregor weighs over thirty stone(420 lbs), nearly all of it muscle, making him near inhumanly strong.</p>

<p>Gregor’s strength allows him to wield a six-foot, two-handed greatsword with just one hand, giving him enormous reach while still wielding a shield. Such is the power of Gregor’s strength that he has been known to hack men in half with just a single blow. In battle he wears the heaviest, thickest plate armor in the <a href="#seven-kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>. His armor is so heavy that no ordinary man would be able to move, let alone fight effectively while wearing it, making him nigh-invincible in combat. Below the plate he wears chainmail and boiled leather. He also wears a plate helm with only a narrow slit for vision, atop of which is a stone fist punching up towards the sky. Gregor carries an extremely thick oaken shield bearing the three black dogs of <a href="#house-clegane">House Clegane</a> on a yellow field.</p>

<p>Gregor is known for his violence and cruelty. Despite being a dim and brutal man he has excellent warrior instincts. He is very solitary, never leaving his own lands except for wars or tournaments.</p>
