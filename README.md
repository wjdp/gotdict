# GOTDict

A community built Kindle dictionary for A Song of Ice and Fire based on the work of [KEC Krew](http://keckrew.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/game-of-thrones-kindle-dictionary.html). While a number of characters have X-Ray entries this dictionary aims to be much more extensive having information on houses, locations, ships, maps and much more. See http://gotdict.wjdp.uk/ for more details and install instructions.

A build is created on every commit to the master branch. The latest build is avaliable to download here: <https://gotdict.wjdp.uk/gotdict.mobi>

## Contributing

This project needs help to improve the quality and quantity of the entries.

- Please [submit issue reports](https://github.com/wjdp/gotdict/issues/new) for all problems with the dictionary.
- Please fork and submit PRs to contribute directly. Guidelines for entries will be drafted soon.

## Project structure

- `_definitions` contains each entry in the dictionary as a [Markdown file](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), each contains a little [YAML frontmatter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) for attributes such as the title. A list of these is shown below
  - `title`: the title of the definition
  - `terms`: a list of terms, other forms of the title that will be recognised in-book
  - `type`: the record type
    - `character`: a character
    - `house`: a house
    - `event`: an event in time
    - `city`: a city
    - `location`: a location
    - `river`: a river
    - `ship`: a ship
    - `word`: definition of an ASOIAF specific or uncommon word used in the books
- `images\` contains all images

Other files are used in the generation of the MOBI file.

## Building from source

The [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator is used to build the dictionary which is then passed to kindlegen to be converted into a MOBI file.

You will need a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) environment with [bundler](http://bundler.io/) and the kindlegen executable from Amazon. The following will get you this on a Linux box:

```
bundle install
mkdir -p bin tmp/kindlegen
curl http://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/kindlegen_linux_2.6_i386_v2_9.tar.gz > tmp/kindlegen.tar.gz
tar zxvf tmp/kindlegen.tar.gz -C tmp/kindlegen
mv tmp/kindlegen/kindlegen bin/
```

To build run `bundle exec rake build`. All output is within `_output/`, the compiled MOBI is `_output/gotdict.mobi`.
